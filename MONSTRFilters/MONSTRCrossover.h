/**
 * Class which provides three band stereo width control. 
 *
 * This class contains three MONSTRBand objects, and may later be expanded
 * to support a variable number of bands.
 *
 * To use this class, use the setter and getter methods to manipulate crossover
 * parameters which are shared by several bands (crossover frequencies), and call
 * the setter and getter methods of each band to manipulate parameters which are
 * particular to each band. Call the reset, setSampleRate and process methods as
 * required.
