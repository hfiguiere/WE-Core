/**
 * A simple bandpass filter which can process mono or stereo signals.
 * Was initially created to remove frequencies at the extremes of the human
 * hearing range to clean up audio but can fulfil any typical bandpass
 * filter purpose.
 *
 * The cutoff frequencies cannot be changed once the object is constructed. 
 *
 * Has methods for processing either a mono or stereo buffer of samples.
 *
 * @see setSampleRate   - recommended to call before performing any processing
