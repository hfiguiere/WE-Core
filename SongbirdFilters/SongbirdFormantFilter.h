 * A class containing a vector of bandpass filters to produce a vowel sound.

 * two objects of this type. (Do not reuse a single object for both channels)
 *
 * To use this class, simply call setFormants, reset, and process as necessary.
 *
 * @see setFormants - must be called before performing any processing
 * @see Formant     - Formant objects are required for operation of this class
